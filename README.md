Adressaway
==========

Adressaway Plus is a Chrome extension that unlocks articles behind the SPID paywall.

Download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/myth/Adressaway/raw/master/package/adressaway-0.3.1.crx).

#### Update

Google Chrome Store has suddenly taken down the extension. My guess is they have received a complaint.
Hence, automatic updates will no longer work, but already installed extensions will continue to be active.

To install the extension manually, just use the download link above.
Type in `chrome://extensions` in Chrome, and just drag and drop the file into the browser.
