Adressaway
==========

Adressaway Plus is a Chrome extension that unlocks articles behind the SPID paywall.

## Installation



#### Option 1: Manual

1. Download [the extension](https://github.com/myth/Adressaway/raw/master/package/adressaway-0.3.1.crx) from GitHub.
2. Type in `chrome://extensions` in the Chrome address bar.
3. Drag and drop the file into the browser.

Attempting to drag and drop the extension with a regular web page open will make Chrome believe it is being injected from that page, and deny adding the extension.

#### Option 2: Chrome Web store

Google Chrome Store has suddenly taken down the extension. My guess is they have received a complaint.
Hence, automatic updates will no longer work, but already installed extensions will continue to be active.
